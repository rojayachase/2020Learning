Here is a home project that I found really interesting. 
The background of the project is a sensor that attaches to the back of a person head, then counts the amount of times the head turns in a certain direction

Here I have extrapulated the data from the sensor, the saved that to a csv file.once that is complete I used python to only calculate the data I found valueable.
